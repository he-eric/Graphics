HW2
Generating a maze - Treat as graph problem, generate midpoints per cell, generate edges between cells
	     	  - can generate 1 specific graph for a given m x n
		  - 3 key bindings, rotate direction with <-, ->, walk forward with up key

homogeneous coordinates, abstract data types
Geometric objects defined by scalars, points, vectors
Each type obey axioms

point   - 1 property: location
scalars - measure distance between two points
	- real #s and complex
	- multiplicative & additivie inverse
vectors - direction & magnitude
	- no fixed location in space

Points are connected by directed line segments
       - diredcted line segments have magnitude, direction
       	 thus a vector

Vectors are equal given same magnitude, direction
Vector arithmetic 	2A = B    OR head-to-tail rule
			->  -->
Addition, scalar multiplication
Zero vector - no magnitutde, undefined orientation
inverse vectors

Point-vector addition   - P = Q + v move from point Q to point P using vector v
Point-point subtraction - P - Q = v

midterm question - explain if some vector arithmetic makes sense

Do not need a coordinate system to define a point
   Having a coordinate system only gives a point coordinates

|av| = |a||v|

Parametric form of a line
P(a) = P0 + ad
Affine sums
P    = Q  + av defines all pts on the line from Q in direction of v
Rewrite v to: R-Q where R is the head of v
P    = Q + a(R-Q)
P    = aR + (1-a)Q

Convex objs
line segs are convex obj

Obj defined by n pts {P1, P2, P3,...Pn}
P = a1P1 + a2P2 + a3P3... + anPn is true of a1 + a2 + ... + an = 1
The pts formed by the affine sum with an > 0 form convex hull
