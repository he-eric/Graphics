how does the math make sense for the color scheme
color coordinates go 0-1
range values of x, y, z -1 to 1
The clipping of the space is (-1,-1,-1) (1,1,1) thus 1 to 1 mapping

if points overlap, how does shader figure out what color to assign
fragment shader colors the fragment multiple times

hidden surface removal algorithms (midterm)
z buffer turned on
render func now includes clearing depth buffer
