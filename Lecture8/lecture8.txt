request mode - buffer not returned until device triggered
	ex: java program waiting on input from trigger "enter key"

sample mode - no trigger necessary, immediate return upon func call
       assumes buffer filled before func call

request/sample modes inadequate for programs that require multiple devices for input

event mode can handle real time interactions
      event queue holds device measure (identifer)

callback
	subdivide events to keyboard, mouse, window events


clients and servers
events and event listeners
