Framebuffer
Rasterization - moving 3D objects to pixels on 2D screen
Graphics pipeline
hidden surface removal - deleting primitives/fragments not visible to you
Fragment processor - what is the color of each fragment and how do you want it to be displayed
What exactly is a fragment? a group of pixels
Clipper and primitive assembler precursor to hidden surface removal

Hardware
GPU ultimately send data to display

Communication CPU - GPU expensive, copy model data to GPU memory once
real time rendering corresponds to at least 30 frames a second
Pre-processing step - done once, rendering step repeated
Transformations data calculated by GPU

Example
js file two parts, vertex and fragment shader code
